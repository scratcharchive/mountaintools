# mountainclient

MountainClient is a Python client for loading, saving, downloading, and uploading files
referenced by MountainTools paths and an interface to remote pairio and
kachery databases, a local key/value store, and a local SHA-1 file cache.
All I/O for MountainTools is handled using this client.

There is a global client that may be imported via

```python
    from mountaintools import client as mt
```

Or you can instantiate a local client object:

```python
    from mountaintools import MountainClient
    mt_client = MountainClient()
```

The global client allows a single configuration to apply to the entire
program, but there are also times when using a local instance is preferred.

By default the client utilizes databases stored in directories on your local
disk, but it can also be used to read and write from remote servers. For
example, the following code saves and retrieves some short text strings
using the local file system as storage.

```python
    from mountaintools import client as mt

    # Setting values (these should be short strings, <=80 characters)
    mt.setValue(key='some-key1', value='hello 1')
    mt.setValue(key=dict(name='some_name', number=2), value='hello 2')

    # Getting values
    val1 = mt.getValue(key='some-key1')
    val2 = mt.getValue(key=dict(name='some_name', number=2))
```

By default these are stored inside the `~/.mountain` database directory. This
location may be configured using the `MOUNTAIN_DIR` environment variable.

While `setValue()` and `getValue()` are limited to working with short strings,
larger objects may be stored using saveText(), saveObject() and saveFile(),
and retrieved using `loadText()`, `loadObject()` and `loadFile()`, as follows:

```python
    from mountaintools import client as mt

    # Local storage of data and files, retrievable by SHA-1 hash
    some_text = 'This is some text'
    path = mt.saveText(some_text, basename='test.txt')
    print(path)
    # Output: sha1://482cb0cfcbed6740a2bcb659c9ccc22a4d27b369/test.txt

    # Later we can use this to retrieve the text
    retrieved_text = mt.loadText(path='sha1://482cb0cfcbed6740a2bcb659c9ccc22a4d27b369/test.txt')

    # ... or retrieve the path to a local file containing the text
    fname = mt.realizeFile(path)
    print(fname)
    # Output: /tmp/sha1-cache/4/82/482cb0cfcbed6740a2bcb659c9ccc22a4d27b369

    # Or we can store some large text by key and retrieve it later
    large_text = 'some large repeating text'*100
    mt.saveText(key=dict(name='key-for-repeating-text'), text=large_text)
    txt = mt.loadText(key=dict(name='key-for-repeating-text'))

    # Similarly we can store simple Python dicts via json content
    some_object = dict(some='object')
    path = mt.saveObject(some_object, basename='object.json')
    print(path)
    # Output: sha1://b77fdda467b03d7a0c3e06f6f441f689ac46e817/object.json

    retrieved_object = mt.loadObject(path=path)
    print(retrieved_object)
    assert json.dumps(retrieved_object) == json.dumps(some_object)

    # Or store objects by key
    some_other_object = dict(some_other='object')
    mt.saveObject(object=some_other_object, key=dict(some='key'))
    obj = mt.loadObject(key=dict(some='key'))
    assert json.dumps(some_other_object) == json.dumps(obj)

    # You can do the same with files
    with open(tempfile.gettempdir()+'/test___.txt', 'w') as f:
        f.write('some file content')
    path = mt.saveFile(tempfile.gettempdir()+'/test___.txt')
    print(path)
    # Output: sha1://ee025361a15e3e8074e9c0b44b4f98aabc829b3d/test___.txt

    # Then load the text of the file at a later time
    txt = mt.loadText(path=path)
    assert txt == 'some file content'

    sha1 = mt.computeFileSha1(path=mt.realizeFile(path))
    txt2 = mt.loadText(path='sha1://'+sha1)
    assert txt2 == 'some file content'
```

The larger content is stored in a disk-backed content-addressable storage
database, located by default at `/tmp/sha1-cache`. This may be configured by
setting the `SHA1_CACHE_DIR` environment variable.

To access content on a remote server, you can use

```python
    from mountaintools import client as mt

    mt.configRemoteReadonly(collection='<collection>', share_id='<id>')
```

where `<kachery-database-name>` refers to a remote kachery database. Depending
on the access configuration of the remote server, you may need to provide
[authorization tokens](../README.md#setting-kachery-tokens).
